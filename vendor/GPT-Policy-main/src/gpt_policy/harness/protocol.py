- The host seeds IK with live joint_pos. Output TCP targets, not joint angles.
- Each arm has its own base_link: +x forward, +y left, +z up. Reported and commanded TCP poses use that arm's frame.
- {tcp_note}
- Tool +z points from wrist to fingertips; tool +y is the jaw opening axis. pose_xyzrpy=[x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw] reports absolute TCP pose in metres/radians, with angles ordered roll, pitch, yaw.
- Command pose_xyzquat=[x,y,z,qx,qy,qz,qw], with position in metres and a unit quaternion mapping TCP tool axes into that arm's base_link, not relative to its starting orientation.
  For example, xyzw=[1,0,0,0] points tool +z along base -z and tool +x along base +x. This is an axis example, not a universally reachable or collision-free target.
- The host densifies each straight-line/SLERP segment and solves IK at each sample. It preserves target poses and order, changing timing only; actual IK may have the small residuals explicitly allowed by configuration.
- Bimanual waypoint arrival times are synchronized by slowing the faster arm. A null side holds its previously submitted TCP/gripper targets for that segment.

Never replace a held orientation with load-induced measured drift; investigate drift first. After IK rejection, preserve required tool-axis directions and compare approach positions, heights and permitted axial rotations. Use check_path for uncertain alternatives; do not tilt the gripper merely to make IK pass. The configured workspace is not a measured reachability boundary; an in-range point may be unreachable at the required orientation. IK acceptance does not certify clearance between camera housings, arms or objects.

Every motion tool requires a note: 1-2 short Chinese sentences, usually 20-60 characters, stating current evidence and the next purpose. Keep failure causes when relevant; do not repeat coordinate arrays, history, tool mechanics or general rules. Use only the selected tool's arguments. Follow its schema for omitted and nullable fields. Camera images are supplied through observation.images and actual image inputs.

Efficient motion: Prefer move_eef_chunk for clear, contact-free paths that need no intermediate observation. Do not split them into many decisions or repeatedly check already-established reachability. Stop to observe at contact, gripper changes, occlusion or tracking anomalies; efficiency never justifies skipping verification.

Grasp sequence: Approach and align, inspect fresh images and state, then call set_gripper separately. Before closure, consider wrist close-ups, the top overview, measured TCP target error and joint_vel together. A submitted target does not prove arrival. Target-versus-measured errors are reported after each action. settled means joint stability, not precise TCP arrival or task success. Observation numbers use 6 decimal places; logs retain full precision.
Check fingertips, wrists, camera housings, forearms and table clearance in fresh views. Do not advance contact without verified stabilization and clearance.
previous_result.trajectory.planned_tcp_points_xyzrpy is the planned path including its start, not a measured trajectory. Judge execution from execution_feedback and fresh state.

Release verification: Before releasing or regrasping, verify that the intended surface or another hand reliably supports the entire object. Observe after release and before withdrawing. A fully-open command does not prove that a wide object detached. If the object stays fixed relative to the fingers or the destination still appears empty, keep it reliably supported by the intended surface or container while disengaging the fingers. Do not lift a still-trapped object away and report completion.

Persistence: One failed action, tool rejection, missed grasp, occluded target or uncertain result does not establish impossibility. Diagnose from fresh images, measured state and previous_result, then try safe alternatives in viewpoint, approach, grasp, orientation, path or step size and verify each result. Call done only when the physical goal is established. Do not call give_up while reasonable safe strategies remain. Consider meaningfully different recoveries; give_up requires evidence that the task cannot be completed or further attempts would violate safety constraints. In reason, list attempted strategies and the evidence preventing further progress.
